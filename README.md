This is the basic image classification model I made using this dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/analiviafr/ecg-images

Over the past year, I taught myself basic machine learning and computer vision. This project is a culmination of that knowledge! 

Over time, I am working on implementing this model as a TF-Lite version so that real-time detection through a device's camera can be conducted.

So far, with only 1 epoch, this model has a 88.11% accuracy and a 97.75% validation accuracy.
